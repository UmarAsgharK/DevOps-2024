# DevOps Course 2024: My Learning Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the **DevOps Course 2024**! This repository documents my journey, insights, and practical applications in the DevOps domain. Below, you'll find summaries of my two key blogs, examples of tools I’ve explored, and practical applications showcasing DevOps practices.

## Blogs Summary

### 1. Introduction to Terraform
In this blog, I explore **Terraform**, a popular Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that simplifies the management of cloud infrastructure. This post covers the basics of Terraform, its benefits, and a step-by-step guide to creating an S3 bucket on AWS.

**Key Takeaways**:
- Understand what **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is and its advantages like automation, consistency, and version control.
- Learn the **key features of Terraform**, including declarative configuration, multi-cloud support, and state management.
- A practical guide to:
  - Setting up a Terraform project.
  - Creating and managing AWS resources using Terraform.
  - Updating and destroying infrastructure efficiently.

**Practical Steps**:
1. Configuring AWS CLI for authentication.
2. Writing `main.tf` files to define cloud resources.
3. Using Terraform commands (`init`, `plan`, `apply`, `destroy`) for infrastructure management.

This blog serves as a foundational guide for beginners looking to explore IaC with Terraform.

### 2. Introduction to Kubernetes: A Beginner’s Guide
This blog introduces **Kubernetes (K8s)**, a leading container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

**Key Takeaways**:
- Learn the basics of Kubernetes, including its **core components**:
  - Pods, Nodes, Deployments, and Services.
- Understand the **benefits of Kubernetes**:
  - Portability, scalability, self-healing, and operational efficiency.
- Discover how Kubernetes simplifies managing modern applications, especially in microservices architectures.

**Getting Started**:
- Experiment with tools like **Minikube** or cloud services like **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**.
- Explore `kubectl` for managing Kubernetes clusters.
- Define and deploy applications using **YAML configuration files**.

This blog is a perfect starting point for those new to Kubernetes and container orchestration.
